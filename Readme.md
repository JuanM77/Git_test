#There was a merge error so I deleted the lines and the "test_branch" and "original" lines, did that fix it?
# hello

# New branch

# The "Test" line has been deleted, this is to create and solve a merge conflict

# This line has been added on the remote repository, I should see it in Git using **git pull oringin master**
